                            Deutsche Bank, a 150-year-old German multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. Deutsche bank is operational in 58 countries having a large presence in Europe, America as well as in Asia. Currently,
                            it is serving as the 15th largest bank in the world and as the largest German bank in the world based on the total assets it is holding. The bank has a rich history and have seen many ups and downs during its life. During its
                            golden period bank has witnessed the peak value of its shares of 112 Euros per share in the year 2006. However, from 2006 onwards its shares have fallen down continuously till the price of a share 6.82 Euros. But a question
                            remains in everyone’s mind is how come a bank with such a rich history which has already survived World War-I, World War-II and the Financial Crisis of year 2008 has come to such disgraceful position.<br>
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="Images/deutsche2.jpg" alt="deutsche bank" class="img-responsive"> <br><br> The downfall of Deutsche Bank actually started from the year 2012. Just like Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank was one of the major drivers of
                            the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market during the housing credit bubble from 2004 to 2008, creating about $32 billion worth. In January 2014, Deutsche Bank reported a €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) pre-tax loss for the
                            fourth quarter of 2013. This came after analysts had predicted a profit of nearly €600 million, according to FactSet estimates. Revenues slipped by 16% versus the prior year. In January 2016, Deutsche Bank pre-announced a 2015
                            loss before income taxes of approximately €6.1 billion and a net loss of approximately €6.7 billion. In addition to all the bad things, in November 2018, the bank had their Frankfurt offices raided by police in connection with
                            ongoing investigations about the Panama papers and money laundering.<br> In order to avoid the bankruptcy conditions like Lehman Brothers, the bank has announced its radical restructuring plan. This restructuring plan firstly
                            involved exit from the global Equities Sales & Trading business. Also, it will restructure the fixed income segment with focus on Rates unit. Deutsche Bank will reduce risk-weighted assets currently allocated to these businesses
                            by nearly 40%. Secondly, Deutsche Bank remains committed to reducing expenses by undertaking restructuring of businesses and infrastructure as it seeks to reduce adjusted costs to €17 billion in 2022. The lender plans to achieve
                            this by cutting 18,000 jobs in the next three years. Also, it is targeting a cost income ratio of 70% and post-tax Return on Tangible Equity of 8% by 2022.<br> As per the Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing, this restructuring
                            would help them to get on the track by 2022 and once again they will have their footprint in the financial sphere.

                            2008, The darkest year for the whole economic world! Some say it as ‘Financial crisis’ year while some say it as ‘Financial Turbulence’, however September 15, 2008 was more like a doomsday for the whole economic world. One of the leading investment banks
                            of US and the investment giant, Lehman Brothers collapsed greatly and went bankrupt on this doomsday resulting the whole stock market to get collapsed in a single day.<br>
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="Images/lehmann2.jpg" alt="deutsche bank" class="img-responsive"> <br><br> Lehman Brothers, the 160-year-old firm, the investment giants, the bank which survived Civil War, Two World Wars, The Great Depression and
                            any other great misfortune had gone bankrupt in a single day. It caused wearing down of the $10 trillion in the market capitalization. But the question arises in everyone’s mind that how a market giant having $639 billion assets
                            value failed to survive and went for bankruptcy.
                            <br> It all started in the mid 90’s when the US was having dot-com-boom, which caused technology company’s shares get high at their peak point and this bubble burst out during 2000 and 2002. The result of this burst out caused
                            share markets to fall and investors had no options to invest as markets were bearish. Because of these bearish conditions interest rates were quite low at that time and people went to take loan from banks to buy house. It caused
                            rise in the real estate market and investors found a new option in the form of real estate to invest. Investment banks took advantage of this market boom and formed a new product called Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)
                            which they used to sell to investors. Lehman Brothers was one of the leading banks which sold most of such CDOs to investors. Lehman obtained mortgage lenders and subprime lenders BNC Mortgage and Aurora Load Services. Lehman
                            real estate recorded revenues in the capital markets which increase 56% from 2004 to 2006 which grew faster than any other investment bank. Every year Lehman recorded profits which they reported net income of $4.2 billion on
                            revenue of $19.3 billion.
                            <br> In 2007 the housing market begins to show signs of slowing down with the defaults of the subprime mortgages which at the time was at a seven-year high. When the credit crisis burst with the failure of hedge funds in Lehman’s
                            stock dramatically dropped. In order to get out of the crisis, Lehman tried to raise funds by offering their shares, but they couldn’t handle the situation anymore and as a result they had to go for bankruptcy. This led one
                            of the biggest bankruptcies of all-time surpassing those of the previous bankrupt giants such as Worldcom and Enron with $639 billion assets and $619 billion in debt. This till date is remembered as one of the darkest year
                            of whole economic sphere.

                            Brexit is an abbreviation for “Britain Exit” or “British Exit”, referring to the United Kingdom’s decision in June 23, 2016 referendum to leave European Union (EU), which is a group of 28 nations together. It all started in 1975, when UKIP (United Kingdom
                            Independence Party) brought referendum for the first time. The referendum was divided into two parts, that is people can either vote for UK to stay in EU or to leave EU. This first ever referendum resulted in 68% of votes to
                            stay in EU and since then referendum started to disappear slowly.

                            in public for Conservative party during the elections. This eventually resulted in a huge win for Conservative party and David Cameron stepped as Prime Minister of UK for the second time. But, to keep his promise he needed
                            to call the referendum again and voting for referendum took place in entire UK on June 23, 2016. During this voting period Conservative party supported for “stay campaign” while the UKIP party supported for “leave campaign”
                            which were led by Nigel Farage. On the voting day, the total voting turned out to be 72.2% with more than 30 million people voting for the referendum. The results of this referendum were astonishing where 51.9% people voted
                            for LEAVE and 48.1% people voted for STAY which turned out the result of referendum as UK to leave the European Union. This result was quite biased according to the regions, where majority of people in England voted for leave,
                            people in Scotland voted for stay, people in Wales voted for leave and the people in Northern Ireland voted for stay.
                            <br> After the results of referendum went in the favor of leave, the Prime Minister and Conservative party leader, David Cameron stepped down as party leader and resigned the post of Prime Minister. The former Home Minster
                            of UK Theresa May stepped as the new Prime Minister of UK on behalf of Conservative party. The results of “Brexit” were quite horrible as the British Pound fall to it’s lowest against the dollar in 30 years. The whole economical
                            market collapsed after the results of Brexit and it affected the whole world. Experts have their say on Brexit as, the result of Brexit would cause whole world’s economy to fall by 0.5%.
                            <br> In order to leave EU formally, UK have to pass the Article 50 in their parliament after which UK initially had two years from that date to negotiate a new relationship with EU. This negotiating period extended twice after
                            the result of referendum and the new Brexit deadline is October 31,2019.

                            Deutsche Bank, a 150-year-old German multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. Deutsche bank is operational in 58 countries having a large presence in Europe, America as well as in Asia. Currently,
                            it is serving as the 15th largest bank in the world and as the largest German bank in the world based on the total assets it is holding. The bank has a rich history and have seen many ups and downs during its life. During its
                            golden period bank has witnessed the peak value of its shares of 112 Euros per share in the year 2006. However, from 2006 onwards its shares have fallen down continuously till the price of a share 6.82 Euros. But a question
                            remains in everyone’s mind is how come a bank with such a rich history which has already survived World War-I, World War-II and the Financial Crisis of year 2008 has come to such disgraceful position.<br>
                            <br><br>
                            <img src="Images/did2.jpg" alt="deutsche bank" class="img-responsive"> <br><br> The downfall of Deutsche Bank actually started from the year 2012. Just like Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank was one of the major drivers of the
                            collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market during the housing credit bubble from 2004 to 2008, creating about $32 billion worth. In January 2014, Deutsche Bank reported a €1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) pre-tax loss for the fourth
                            quarter of 2013. This came after analysts had predicted a profit of nearly €600 million, according to FactSet estimates. Revenues slipped by 16% versus the prior year. In January 2016, Deutsche Bank pre-announced a 2015 loss
                            before income taxes of approximately €6.1 billion and a net loss of approximately €6.7 billion. In addition to all the bad things, in November 2018, the bank had their Frankfurt offices raided by police in connection with ongoing
                            investigations about the Panama papers and money laundering.<br> In order to avoid the bankruptcy conditions like Lehman Brothers, the bank has announced its radical restructuring plan. This restructuring plan firstly involved
                            exit from the global Equities Sales & Trading business. Also, it will restructure the fixed income segment with focus on Rates unit. Deutsche Bank will reduce risk-weighted assets currently allocated to these businesses by
                            nearly 40%. Secondly, Deutsche Bank remains committed to reducing expenses by undertaking restructuring of businesses and infrastructure as it seeks to reduce adjusted costs to €17 billion in 2022. The lender plans to achieve
                            this by cutting 18,000 jobs in the next three years. Also, it is targeting a cost income ratio of 70% and post-tax Return on Tangible Equity of 8% by 2022.<br> As per the Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing, this restructuring
                            would help them to get on the track by 2022 and once again they will have their footprint in the financial sphere.

                    <p align="justify">The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is massive. But just how big are we talking? Well, with more than 2,400 companies trading on it, and 1.6 billion shares traded every day, it’s a hive of activity. And with a combined market capitalization
                        of approximately $22.59 trillion (as of March 2018), it significantly dwarfs its nearest rival, the Nasdaq (market cap of around $11 trillion) as the largest stock exchange in the world. Like we said. Massive.</p>

                    <p align="justify">When you listen to early-morning financial commentators, they’ll almost always discuss what happened in China while you were tucked up in bed. This level of media coverage might make you think that China’s stock market is a major player,
                        but the truth is, it’s not. Not yet, anyway. At the moment, it makes up a very small percentage of the global equity market. Only 3.1% to be precise. Compared to the 51.3% the US represents, China has a long way to go. </p>
